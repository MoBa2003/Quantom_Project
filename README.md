# Quantum Computing Project 🧠⚛️

This repository contains the final project for the *Algorithm Design* course at Iran University of Science and Technology. The goal is to introduce basic quantum computing concepts and practice programming with Q# using simple quantum gates.

## 🧪 Project Overview

This project consists of 6 quantum programming exercises implemented in **Q#**. Each task focuses on a key concept of quantum computing such as:

1. **Uniform Superposition**  
2. **GHZ State Construction**  
3. **Superposition with a Basis State**  
4. **Entanglement of Qubits**  
5. **Zero State Detection**  
6. **Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm**

Each problem is provided with a partially completed `Test` function that must be completed to implement the correct quantum logic.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

To run the code, you need:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Azure Quantum Development Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk) extension for Q#
- Q# SDK

After setting up, clone the repository and open it in VS Code to run the tests.

## 📚 Learning Resources

These resources were used and recommended for learning and solving problems:

- Jonathan Hui's Quantum Computing Series on Medium  
- [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists (slides & video)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/05/40655.compressed.pdf)  
- [IBM Quantum Composer](https://quantum.ibm.com/composer/)  
- [Microsoft Quantum Documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/)  
- [Shor’s Algorithm Explained (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUwZZaI5u0c)

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal is to understand quantum algorithms and learn basic Q# programming through practice and experimentation with quantum gates.
